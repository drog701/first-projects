# first-projects
This is my first repository!

This is my first time using GitHub in hopes to learn how to use it well. This project is derived through freecodecamp.org, but
I wanted to make it available for anyone that might be interested in it. Also, I wanted to make it available for possible changes
because there are a lot of great minds out there and I certainly know that it can get better. Thanks for your contributions!
